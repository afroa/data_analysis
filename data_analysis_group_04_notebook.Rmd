#Reading the data into a new dataframe

md_median_household_income <- read.csv("data/md_median_household_income.csv")

# Cleaning the data

clean_rows <- md_median_household_income %>%
  filter(Data == "Income") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  t() 

flipped_rows <- as.data.frame(clean_rows)
  
flipped_rows %>%
  rename(flipped_rows, V1 = "2010")

#  mutate(COUNTY = toupper(str_remove_all(COUNTY,", West Virginia|County"))) %>%
#  mutate(COUNTY = str_trim(COUNTY,side="both"))

```
